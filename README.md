# ADOC - Community Oversight

Community Oversight Project of the ADOC inJustices

This project is an effort to log and track as much of the information that the state of Alabama Dept. of Corrections is attempting to hide and obfuscate from the public: inluding the details of deaths that happen to humans under the supervision of ADOC facilities.
